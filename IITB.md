## My Journey at IITB
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In 2018, after completing my bachelor's degree, I joined the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) for my Master's in Mechanical Design Engineering. Gaining admission to IITB was a milestone in my academic journey—I appeared for GATE 2018 in Mechanical Engineering and secured a score of 811/1000 with an impressive 99.94 percentile among 190,000 candidates.

At IITB, I had the privilege of learning from some of the most renowned professors in the country and collaborating with brilliant minds in mechanical engineering. My coursework covered core topics such as:
</p>

- Stress Analysis
- Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery
- System Modeling, Dynamics, and Control
- Robotics
- Computer-Aided Simulation of Machines
- Design Optimization
- Design for Manufacturing

<p style="text-align: justify;">

 As I progressed through my master’s program, my interest in  robotics grew stronger. This passion led me to focus my thesis on Human-Robot Collaboration for Object Handling using a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot.

My time at IITB was a transformative phase that laid the foundation for my deeper exploration into robotics, automation, and intelligent systems.

During my time at IITB, I had the opportunity to grow not only technically but also in terms of soft skills and leadership. I was determined to explore every activity I had ever wanted to be a part of. Getting a second chance to experience college life, I was committed to making the most of my time and ensuring that I invest my time wisely.
