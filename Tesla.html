								As a Production Control Intern at Tesla, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved
								automating internal material handling processes in the General Assembly (GA) area. My primary focus was on 
								analyzing the current processes, routes, and headcounts to identify areas for cost savings and efficiency improvements. 
								I collaborated with various teams to gather data and insights, which helped me develop a proposal for implementing
								 Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) to optimize material handling operations. Through simulation and analysis, I was able to 
								 determine the optimal number of AMRs needed for the GA3 process routes, ultimately leading to a significant reduction in 
								 headcount and improved operational efficiency.

								After removing the Dematic Fixed automation solution from warehouse to GA3 lifters,
								all the processes were dependent on the internal material handling labor.
								This inherently caused a lot of delays in the process and increased the headcount for the internal material handling labor.
								There was alot of inefficiency in delivering the material to the site because of redundant buffer zones due to the labor dependency.
								One of the such sites was delivering door trims to the lifters in GA3. The aisles and highways are very narrow and congested as they were not designed for manual material handling.

								Once the situation was analyzed, the next step was to identify possible ways
								 to eliminate the recurring costs on this GA line. The recurring cost in this 
								 case was the manpowerâ€”three workers per shift across four shifts. The door t
								 rim racks were extremely heavy, leading to frequent ergonomic issues for the 
								 labor force. Additionally, due to the continuous heavy maneuvering of these 
								 racks, associates would become fatigued over time, resulting in careless 
								 handling and ultimately causing mechanical damage to the dollies. Hence to 
								 address this issue, the only way to work around was to automate door trim delivery
								 process using felixible automation that is Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)/(AGVs).
								 How the question was its feasibility and how many AMRs are needed?

								To address the issue, I proposed a solution to automate the door trim 
								delivery process using Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). The first step was to 
								analyze the current process routes, station QPC, QPV, Frequency and identify the best routes for the AMRs. 
								Then I proposed these routes to all the stateholders such as Process team, Induatrial engineering Team,
								Mechanical Equipment team, EHS, EPC teams and noted all the risks that each team forcasted in 
								the plan proposed. I rivised the routes and processes considering all the
								feedback from the teams. With the help of my manager's approval I was able to contact the 
								AMR vendorrs with the required RFQs and the AMR vendors were able to propose the solution.
								Next step was evaluation of the AMR vendors and Validation of the AMR solution.

								I am grateful to my manager for introducing me to and granting access to the Confluence 
								pages, which allowed me to explore how other departments were conducting material handling 
								analyses. This access provided valuable insights into best practices and techniques used
								 across Tesla facilities worldwide. Through this, I discovered that other plants utilized
								  the FlexSim software tool to validate processes and conduct time studies before 
								  implementation on the GA line.<br><br>

								Going beyond my role, I proactively reached out to Nevadaâ€™s Material Flow team to request 
								access to the software and 
								training. I quickly learned FlexSim and successfully simulated the process to validate the 
								AMR solution. This enabled me to determine the optimal number of AMRs required and the most 
								efficient routes for them. Additionally, I assessed vendor-proposed AMR solutions to evaluate
								 their reliability.<br><br>

								Ultimately, I compiled my findings into a business case for the AMR solution which 
								resulted into <B>ROI of less than 2 years</B> and presented it to the management team.
