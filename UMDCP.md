### My Journey at UMDCP
<p style="text-align: justify;">

Pursuing my Master’s in Robotics Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park has been an exciting and transformative experience. From diving deep into robot perception, reinforcement learning, and autonomous systems to working hands-on with ROS2, Gazebo, and real-world robotic platforms, every challenge has strengthened my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.

Collaborating with brilliant peers and faculty, I’ve tackled cutting-edge projects in aerial robotics, humanoid systems, and machine learning-driven decision-making, further refining my passion for innovation in robotics. UMDCP has not only expanded my knowledge but also reinforced my vision of building technology that improves lives on a global scale.
