### Work Experience
***
#### [Production Control Intern, Tesla, Inc.](./Tesla.md)
Fremont ,CA _(May 2024 - Present)_
- Developed a proposal for automating internal material handling labor intensive processes to the General Assembly

- Analyzed all the processes for General Assembly 3/s/x/y , routes , QPC, QPV , headcounts , for cost saving  the proposal.

- Working on the simulation of proposed strategy for deploying Autonomous Mobile Robots on the GA3 process routes.

#### [Robotics New Product Development Manager at Armstrong Dematic](./AMSTG.md)
Pune, India _(July 2021 - May 2023)_
1. **Autonomous Mobile Robots for Handling Pallets of 1 ton**

	- Prepared the case study for handling filled pallets from Robotic palletizing cells to  	Automatic Storage and Retrieval System(ASRS) and identified the Key features, interlocks needed to execute the system
	- Contributed in mechanical design calculation for selection and manufacturing various components of the system saving 30% of overall cost of the AMR to the company
2. **Robotic Vision-based Depalletizing System**
	- Designed in-house Vision-based Robotic Depalletizing system using 3D camera and Yaskawa GP12 robot
	- Developed a versatile algorithm that can integrate with any size of an industrial articulated robot with the camera on a gripper as well as the camera on a fixed stand based on application

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
