#### [Production Control Intern ](./Tesla.md)
[**Tesla, Inc.**](./Tesla.md) | Fremont ,CA _(May 2024 - Present)_
- Developed a proposal for automating internal material handling labor intensive processes to the General Assembly

- Analyzed all the processes for General Assembly 3/s/x/y , routes , QPC, QPV , headcounts , for cost saving  the proposal.

- Worked on the simulation and  proposed strategy that helped to reduce headcount by implementing optimum number of Autonomous Mobile Robots on the GA3 process routes.
